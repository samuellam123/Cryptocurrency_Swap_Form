#About Me

Hello! My name is Lam Yu En (Samuel), a 2nd year Computer Science student at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), currently specializing in **Fintech** with a minor in AI. 

I have a passion for creating intuitive and impactful UI/UX solutions, and have recently won the <u>4th place</u> in an international UI/UX hackathon, even though it mainly emphatize on HTML and CSS, and with limited JavaScript. 

Completing this code challenge made me realize that my experience with React JS is minimal, and I have tried my best to complete all 3 problems within the given deadline. However, I am highly motivated and eager to improve my skills in this area. Fortunately, my current university course includes JavaScript and React JS, and by the end of this term, I aim to have mastered the basics. Additionally, to supplement my classroom learning, I plan to undertake self-directed study in React, Redux, React Saga, and TypeScript.

Through this internship at **Switcheo Lab**, I aim to deepen my knowledge and skills in blockchain technology as well as gaining frontend experience in industry level. 

Really looking forward to the good news! Thank you so much for considering my application.
